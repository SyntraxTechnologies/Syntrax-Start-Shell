GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and
(2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that requires permission under copyright law.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that:

Displays an appropriate copyright notice, and

Tells the user that there is no warranty, and

Gives instructions on how to view a copy of this License.

1. Source Code

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

The “Corresponding Source” means all the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code.

2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright.

You may run the Program for any purpose.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under applicable law.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code provided that you:

Publish appropriate copyright notices

Keep intact all notices stating that this License applies

Give recipients a copy of this License

You may charge any price or no price.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey modified versions provided that you:

State that you changed the files

License the entire work under AGPL v3

Display Appropriate Legal Notices (if interactive)

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey object code provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source in one of the allowed ways, including:

Bundled source

Written offer

Network access

7. Additional Terms

You may add additional permissions but may not impose further restrictions.

8. Termination

If you violate the License, your rights terminate automatically.

Rights may be reinstated if violations are corrected.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License merely to receive or run a copy.

However, modifying or distributing indicates acceptance.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors.

11. Patents

Contributors grant a patent license for their contributions.

12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom

You may not impose additional restrictions.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License

If you modify the Program and run it on a server, you must provide the source code to users interacting with it remotely.

This is the key clause that distinguishes AGPL from GPL.

You may link AGPL code with GPLv3 code under certain conditions.

14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions.

If the Program specifies “AGPL v3 or later,” you may use any later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

16. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
